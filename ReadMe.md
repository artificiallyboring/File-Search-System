# File Search System

This is a simple GUI application. Given an input file name, it traverses through directories and subdirectories of a drive to search the file. Also, if only extensions are given, it lists out all the paths of the files with that extensions.

**For executing the file:-**
- Download `FileSearch.java`.
- Open Terminal and `cd` into the directory in which it is downloaded.
- After this, run `javac FileSearch.java`
- And then, run `java FileSearch`, then search the file.
